# Implementation Plan: Gemini OpenAI-Compatible Proxy Server

**Branch**: `002-read-prd-md` | **Date**: 2025-09-29 | **Spec**: [`specs/002-read-prd-md/spec.md`](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-read-prd-md/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

The feature delivers a Bun-hosted proxy at `http://localhost:4806/v1` that mirrors OpenAI APIs while forwarding traffic to the Gemini upstream. It must provide transparent schema compatibility, automated key rotation with circuit breaking, persistence-backed health tracking, and operational tooling (metrics, logs, admin endpoints) so existing OpenAI clients can adopt Gemini without code changes.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x on Bun 1.x runtime  
**Primary Dependencies**: `undici` (HTTP client), `pino` (logging), `prom-client` (metrics), `yaml` (configuration)  
**Storage**: SQLite (primary state store) with JSON export/import fallback  
**Testing**: `bun test` covering unit and contract suites in `tests/`  
**Target Platform**: Headless Bun service on Linux/macOS servers bound to `0.0.0.0:4806`
**Project Type**: Single backend proxy service  
**Performance Goals**: <100 ms additional latency overhead, ≤10 s total request timeout, ≥99% successful routed requests  
**Constraints**: 10 MB default payload cap, static admin bearer token, immediate key rotation on Gemini 429, graceful shutdown with state persistence  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports dozens of concurrent client integrations with multi-key rotation and ops observability requirements

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Core Principles**: Project constitution template (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) contains no enforced principles; default to repository guidelines in `MEMORY/AGENTS.md` (TypeScript style, testing, security). No conflicts detected.
- **Governance**: Existing artifacts (`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`) adhere to repo conventions—no additional structures or dependencies beyond scope.
- **Risk Review**: Key rotation, persistence, and observability decisions stay within Bun + SQLite stack; no mandates violated.
- **Status**: PASS (initial and post-design)

```

**Structure Decision**: Single-service backend under `src/` with domain-focused folders (router, keys, persistence, observability) and supporting contract/integration tests under `tests/`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. Confirmed runtime, storage, configuration, and resilience decisions in `research.md` with trade-off analysis for Bun, SQLite, YAML hot reloads, and circuit breaker thresholds.
2. Captured integration patterns for OpenAI SDK compatibility, Prometheus metrics exposure, and graceful shutdown to meet observability and reliability goals.
3. All clarifications from the spec are resolved—no outstanding unknowns; research artifacts ready for downstream design.

### Phase 0 Output

- `specs/002-read-prd-md/research.md` (complete)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Prerequisites

- `research.md` complete

1. `data-model.md` enumerates API Key, Health Score, Request Metrics, Circuit Breaker State, and Configuration entities with validation and SQLite schema definitions to support persistence and rotation logic.
2. `contracts/proxy-api.yaml` and `contracts/admin-api.yaml` outline OpenAI-compatible proxy endpoints plus admin/metrics routes required for operational control.
3. Contract coverage drives `tests/contract/proxy-api.test.ts` scaffolding (failing until implementation) to enforce schema fidelity and error handling expectations.
4. `quickstart.md` traces acceptance criteria, edge cases (all keys unhealthy, oversized payloads), and performance validation steps runnable via curl/OpenAI SDK to prove the feature end-to-end.
5. **TODO**: After plan approval, run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh kilocode` to sync AI helper context with finalized tech stack.

### Phase 1 Output

- `data-model.md`
- `contracts/*.yaml`
- `quickstart.md`
- Contract tests (existing but still failing until implementation)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

This section describes what the /tasks command will do; do not execute it during `/plan`.

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base input.
- Derive development tasks from `data-model.md`, `contracts/*.yaml`, and `quickstart.md` artifacts.
- Map each contract endpoint to contract test + implementation tasks, each entity to persistence/service tasks [P], and each acceptance scenario to integration test + fulfillment tasks.

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Enforce TDD: extend contract/integration tests before implementing proxy, rotation, persistence behaviors.
- Sequence persistence primitives (SQLite schema, repository) before router/health services; follow with admin/observability layers.
- Flag independent YAML config tooling and metrics instrumentation tasks as [P] for parallel execution once core proxy loop exists.

**Estimated Output**: ~25-30 ordered tasks captured in `specs/002-read-prd-md/tasks.md` by `/tasks` command.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

**Note:** These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

*No deviations from constitutional or repository guidelines identified.*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | – | – |
