## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: Which OpenAI endpoint set must the proxy support in the initial release? ‚Üí A: All OpenAI endpoints streaming
- Q: Which authentication control should protect admin and debug endpoints? ‚Üí A: Static token optional via YAML config
- Q: How should API keys be managed? ‚Üí A: YAML file with hot reload via file watching
- Q: What should determine the health scoring calculation? ‚Üí A: Simple success/failure ratio over fixed window
- Q: What should trigger the circuit breaker to disable a key? ‚Üí A: 3 consecutive failures
- Q: What should be the default maximum request payload size? ‚Üí A: 10 MB default limit
- Q: Which endpoint coverage should the proxy prioritize? ‚Üí A: Full OpenAI v1 API surface
- Q: How should the system behave during persistence failures? ‚Üí A: Switch to backup persistence mechanism (file-based fallback)
- Q: What should be the fallback behavior when response translation fails? ‚Üí A: Return raw Gemini response with error headers
- Q: When Gemini returns 429 (rate limit) responses, what should be the immediate retry behavior? ‚Üí A: Immediate rotation to next healthy key
- Q: What should be the maximum total request timeout including upstream calls? ‚Üí A: timeout 10s

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A backend engineer uses an existing OpenAI SDK pointed at `http://localhost:4806/v1` to access Gemini capabilities. The proxy transparently forwards the request, selects a healthy API key, and returns a response that matches OpenAI schemas so downstream integrations continue working without code changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the proxy is running with at least one healthy API key, **When** a client sends a standard OpenAI-compatible completion request, **Then** the proxy forwards it to Gemini and returns the Gemini response mapped to the OpenAI schema within the target latency budget (<100 ms overhead) and total timeout of 10 seconds.
2. **Given** one API key begins returning 429 errors, **When** the proxy receives multiple failures across the configured window, **Then** the key is rotated out, another healthy key is used automatically, and operators are notified via logs and metrics.
3. **Given** the proxy server is restarted, **When** it comes back online, **Then** it retains all key health scores and usage history from before the restart
4. **Given** an ops team member accesses the health endpoint, **When** they check system status, **Then** they can see which keys are active, disabled, or recovering with clear diagnostic information

### Edge Cases

- When every configured API key is unhealthy, the proxy must surface a 503 response with actionable context while continuing health checks for automated recovery.
- When the YAML configuration is reloaded during active traffic, in-flight requests must finish cleanly and new rotation data must take effect without downtime.
- When primary persistence data cannot be written (e.g., SQLite unavailable), the proxy must automatically switch to file-based fallback persistence, log the condition, and alert operators about the degraded resilience mode.
- How does the system handle malformed requests from clients?
- When the Gemini API returns unexpected response formats that cannot be translated to OpenAI schemas, the proxy must return the raw Gemini response with additional headers indicating translation failure and original response preservation.
- How does the system behave under high concurrent load?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The proxy MUST expose an OpenAI-compatible HTTP interface at `http://localhost:4806/v1`, forwarding requests to the Gemini upstream while preserving paths, query parameters, and headers.
- **FR-002**: The proxy MUST translate Gemini responses and error payloads into OpenAI schema equivalents, with fallback to returning raw Gemini responses plus error headers when translation fails, ensuring client applications can handle both scenarios.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST automatically rotate across configured API keys using health-aware selection that respects per-key quotas and cooldown rules.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST persist key metadata, health scores, and usage history with automatic fallback to file-based persistence when the primary storage fails, ensuring restarts resume with the latest operational state.
- **FR-005**: The proxy MUST enforce circuit breaking that temporarily removes failing keys, applies exponential backoff, and reintroduces keys after successful recovery checks.
- **FR-006**: Operators MUST have endpoints or mechanisms to view health metrics, logs, and key status, including the ability to manually enable, disable, or reprioritize keys.
- **FR-007**: The configuration MUST be managed via a YAML file that supports hot reloads and optional JSON export/import for portability.
- **FR-008**: The proxy MUST provide structured observability, including Prometheus-style metrics, masked logging, and health summaries for operational monitoring.
- **FR-009**: The proxy MUST enforce request validation, immediate key rotation on 429 responses, 10-second total request timeouts, and graceful shutdown behaviors to maintain reliability under failures.
- **FR-010**: The proxy MUST support streaming and non-streaming interactions for the complete OpenAI v1 API surface (completions, chat, embeddings, models, files, fine-tuning, etc.), excluding legacy-only variants.
- **FR-011**: Admin and debug endpoints MUST require a static bearer token drawn from YAML configuration, with the option to disable auth only when explicitly set.
- **FR-012**: System MUST mask API keys in all logs and debug output
- **FR-013**: System MUST gracefully handle service shutdown while preserving state
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate request payload sizes against configurable limits (default: 10 MB maximum)
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **API Key Profile**: Represents a Gemini credential with attributes for friendly name, weight, health score, success/error counters, cooldown timers, and manual status overrides.
- **Proxy Request Session**: Captures each incoming client call, including request metadata, selected key, latency, outcome classification, and response mapping details.
- **Operational Snapshot**: Persists the aggregated key metrics, rotation order, and configuration versioning needed for restart recovery and auditing.
- **Request Metrics**: Tracks success/failure counts, latency, and error classifications per key
- **Health Score**: Numerical representation (0.0-1.0) calculated as success/failure ratio over a fixed time window
- **Circuit Breaker State**: Tracks whether a key is active, disabled, or in recovery mode
- **Configuration**: Stores key metadata, rotation weights, and operational parameters
